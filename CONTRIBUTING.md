# Contributing to Security Filter Lists

Thank you for your interest in contributing!  

## How to contribute
1. **Report false positives or breakage** via GitHub Issues.  
2. **Submit updates** via Pull Requests only if you are confident about the security impact.  
3. **Maintain focus**: only add filters related to security edge cases.  

## Style guidelines
- Keep filters compatible with one or more of the target adblockers (uBlock Origin, AdGuard, Brave Shields, ABP).  
- Include exceptions to avoid breakage as much as possible.
- Avoid aggressive tracking or generic ad-blocking rules.

## Review
All PRs will be reviewed to ensure minimal false positives, no site breakage and correct formatting.
