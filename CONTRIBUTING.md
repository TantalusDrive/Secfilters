# How to contribute (always appreciated)

1. Report false positives or site breakage via GitHub Issues.
2. Submit updates via Pull Requests only if you are confident about the security impact.
3. Keep the scope narrow: only add filters addressing security edge cases.

## Style guidelines

- Ensure filters remain compatible with at least one target engine: uBlock Origin, AdGuard, Brave Shields, or ABP.
- Include exceptions where necessary to prevent breakage.
- Avoid generic adblocking or tracking rules.

## Review process

All PRs are reviewed to confirm:

- Minimal false positives.
- No site breakage.
- Correct syntax and formatting.
